Summary: WiCS Frequenctly Asked Questions

Here you will find answers to questions we commonly receive. If you have a 
question not listed below, please do not hesitate to reach out to us!

# Why do you sometimes hold women-only events? #

An example of an event that's women-only is our mentoring program, where we 
match up junior female students with more senior female students to talk 
about their experiences and support them throughout their academic career. 
Women can obviously seek out male mentors as well but they don't quite share 
the same experiences so the impact of the mentoring is not the same. There 
are also events that are traditionally very competitive (such as hackathons) 
that women feel more comfortable coming out to if they're women-only. 

Holding events which are only open to women helps some women deal with
[exceptionalism](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Exceptionalism 
"Geek Feminism Wiki: Exceptionalism") and 
[stereotype threat](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Stereotype_threat
"Geek Feminism Wiki: Stereotype Threat").

Our women-only events are not publicly advertised and we always 
**very explicitly** specify if an event is going to be women-only.


# What does women-only mean? #

Borrowing from Double Union's 
[membership policy](http://www.doubleunion.org/membership 
"Double Union: Membership"), by "women-only"  we mean if you identify as 
women in some way which is significant to you (including trans, queer,
cis, gender non-conforming, and etc ... ) 

# How can I get involved? #

Please see the Volunteer Opportunities section on our [About page](/about).


# I have a food sensitivity. Can you accomodate me at catered events? #

Yes, we would be happy to! Please try to notify us of your allergies at
least a week in advance of the event. We usually have vegetarian, vegan,
and gluten-free options available. 


# What is the difference between this WiCS and the other one? #

This is the student-run undergraduate WiCS group. The other is run by the
School of Computer Science.
