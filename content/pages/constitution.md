# Structure of Organization #

The Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Subcomittee is a
subcommittee of Women in Computer Science, a standing committee of the
Cheriton School of Computer Science. For the remainder of this document,
this standing committee will be referred to as the "WiCS Committee". All
references to: "the undergraduate committee", "the committee", and
"committee members" refer to the Undergraduate Subcommittee unless
otherwise specified.

## Purpose and Vision ##

The undergraduate committee aims to create a safe environment for cis
and trans women as well as non-binary individuals in computer science,
and to advocate for the inclusion of these marginalized groups in the
computer science community at large.

## Representation ##

The Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Subcommittee aims to
represent and support undergraduate cis and trans women, and non-binary
individuals in computer science. Additionally, we seek to include and
support members of all underrepresented groups in the fields of
technology and computing, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds
possible.

## Values ##

1.  Inclusiveness: The undergraduate commitee is committed to creating
    and inclusive environment in which women of all backgrounds will
    feel welcome.

2.  Humility: In all it's activities, the committee will acknowledge and
    respect the perspectives of those with experiences different to
    ours, and will strive to understand and incorporate these
    perspectives.

    difference in opinions and values.

    promote accountability, and all decision-making will be open and
    well-documented.

5.  Honesty: The committee will create an environment to promote honest
    disclosure. All members should feel free speaking about any opinions
    and feelings.

6.  Technical Excellence: The committee acknowledges that it's
    fundamental goal is to support diversity in technical work, and
    members will strive to achieve excellence in this work themselves.

    the CoC. The committee must ratify any proposed amendments to the

## Succession Procedure ##

1.  No later than the end of the first week of the fourth month of the
    current term, a call for committee members should be announced on
    the website and sent out to all affiliated mailing lists.

2.  New volunteers caan apply to be on the committee for the following
    term, and the current committee will select applicants for
    interviews. A new volunteer shall be anyone who has never served on
    the committee before, or has not served on the committee for 4 or
    more terms. Interviewers should be chosen by the current committee.
    If an interviewer has a conflict of interest with the interviewee,
    an alternate interviewer will be chosen. In any case, if no
    interviewer is explicitly chosen, the current Chair shall conduct
    interviews. The interviews are intended to welcome the new member to
    the committee, give them background on the committee's activities,
    and help them find a role for the next term. The current committee
    will ultimately select the comoposition of the committee for next
    term.

3.  Existing committee members can nominate themselves for positions on
    the next term's committee given the following conditions:

    -   No member may serve more than three consecutive terms;

    -   No member may serve as Chair for more than one term
        consecutively;

    -   No member intending to serve as Chair or Secretary may be on
        co-op;

    -   Members wishing to nominate themselves for chair should be a
        previous WiCS committee member. If no such volunteer exists, the
        position opens up to new members;

    -   Excluding that of Chair, no positions may be chosen until the
        first official meeting of the new term's committee;

    -   Existing committee members may compose no more than 75% of the
        new committee, if more existing members are nominated than 75%
        can accomodate, each returning member will submit a new
        application to be reviewed by the serving Director of the WiCS
        Committee.

4.  If there are any objections to an applicant, this procedure should
    be followed:

    1.  The objection will be presented to the committee, with
        sufficient evidence;

    2.  The person being objected to may present a defense;

    3.  The current committee will then take a vote, if a majority of
        members agree with the objection, the objected person will be
        denied a position on the committee.

    If the objection is a sensitive concern, it can be brought up to the
    Chair or Secretary, where they will decide whether to bring the case
    to the committee and how to proceed. Otherwise, the objected person
    will be automatically accepted for the next term.

5.  Once the committee has been chosen, the Director of the WiCS
    Committee must ratify the new committeee.

    as necessary. Such standing committees can be dissolved by the
    undergraduate committee.

## Keys ##

-   Keys will be allocated to the undergraduate committeee as per policy
    set out in the Memorandum of Understanding with the Mathematics
    Society;

-   Office Manager and Systems Administrator will both receive keys.
    Remaining keys will be allocated as the undergraduate committee sees
    fit.
