Title: MUA Summary
Status: hidden

Anyone with a user account on a WiCS machine must sign our [Machine Usage Agreement]({filename}/pages/mua.md),
summarized below. Those using available guest accounts do not need to sign the MUA, but they are still held
to the rules and regulations outlined in it.

# Acceptable and Unacceptable Use #

The WiCS machines are to be used for learning, class work, personal projects, and 
use in accordance with [WiCS aims]({filename}/pages/about.md), the full [MUA]({filename}/pages/mua.md),
university policy, and local law.

If you have a project of interest that does not fall into these categories, or you have 
questions as to whether the project is permitted under the various policies you may
submit a request to the Systems Committee.

# User Responsibilities #

All usage of WiCS machines is governed by our [CoC]({filename}/pages/code-of-conduct.md), 
our [MUA]({filename}/pages/mua.md), local laws, and University policy. Users are also
responsible for being aware of and adhering to policy of machines connected to from 
WiCS machines. This means, among other things, that machines may not be used for
commercial purposes, including the hosting of corporate websites and mining cryptocurrency.

WiCS is not responsible for any activity on user accounts. Users will be held accountable 
for all damaging, unethical and illegal activity.

Users should be considerate of others' needs when using WiCS machines. Do not disrupt the 
work of anyone else, and do not hog resources.

# Security #

Users are only permitted to access their own accounts. Do not attempt to gain access to anotherâ€™s
account or personal files. 

Do not attempt to obtain anyone else's password, and do not give your password or provide 
access to your account to anyone else. 

We recommend you choose a password that you do not use anywhere else, and do not give any
machine automatic access to your WiCS account.

In the event that you discover a security problem, members of [The Systems Committee](mailto:wics-sys@lists.uwaterloo.ca)
must be notified immediately. The problem should not be exploited, and it should not be made
public until it is corrected.

# Auditing and Logging #

The Systems Committee will keep logs on all machines for diagnostic and auditing purposes.
These logs contain records of user and machine activity, and may be shared with University
Computing or local law enforcement as required.

# Rights of the Systems Committee and the WiCS Executive #

The Systems Committee may examine any file or program that appears to be in violation of 
usage policies. Processes may be killed, stopped, or interrupted at the discretion 
of the Systems Committee, and the owner will be notified.

The Systems Committee may revoke a user's access to an account provided that written 
explanation is given. Any violation of the MUA, CoC, University policy, or local law 
may result in removal of access. Users may appeal to the WiCS Undergraduate Committee for 
reinstatement of revoked access.

The WiCS Undergraduate Committee may update any policy with reasonable notice.

# Summary of a Summary #

Please use the WiCS machines responsibly, and be considerate of others. The WiCS Systems 
Committee reserves the right to revoke access from anyone engaging in irresponsible or 
illegal activity.
